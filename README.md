"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." 
- Lao Tzu

Introduction
    Every expedition from the Mayflower to Google has at least one thing in common since the dawn of human existence. The first step. You can dream a dream for years. Envision on where the trip might take you. Bask in the good feelings those thoughts present to you. However, if you never take a step then you are no closer to your goal today than you were yesterday or 22 years ago. It was then in 1999 that I had a passion for gaming. But I wanted more out of it, I wanted to be able to tell others of my experience and successes that they may too find ways to be better. A website I frequented that was full of hints and tips was looking for writers. I suck at writing, but to me that was not my roadblock. It was HTML. Within a few weeks I searched and read what I could to be at least fluent enough in HTML to post updates to a website. It worked. I was accepted. Technically my journey in coding had begun there but I was not wrapped up in that. Eventually the gaming led me to a "macro" program. I was fascinated. A bunch of gibberish code enabled my onscreen character to automate and do things I could never fathom possible. I wanted more. But to do more I had to learn more. A hell of a lot more. So I read, tinkered, and experiment... over time I went from basics to some pretty elaborate routines that would run for 24+ hours. Amassing in-game wealth and items. But that was never the actual point. I was amazed I could make it do something by writing code, then sitting back and watching the results. I was hooked. But life had other ideas.

Renasissance Man

    Much has happened in the past 18 years since I last touched my very amateur method of coding. I have not coded since. I am a US Military Veteran. I managed a retail pharmacy store for a few years. Worked on military and civilian aircraft. Overseen heavy construction projects in the power generation industry. Never saitisifed or overwhelmingly happy with my career choices they have all brought me to now. Along with a dash of pandemic that led me to consider a new career where remote work was possible. The obstacle is still learning to code. The right way this time. With the end result being able to sustain my means and enjoy life to best one can.

The Path

    Moving forward I will provide more updates on this trek. But for now the plan is to learn Python. Making a daily commitment to code and utilize Github as a means to show my work and progress. This will not happen overnight nor will it conclude as a "get rich quick scheme". The fact is, the only ultimate scale as to which I can measure any form of success is through one solid factor. Hard work. The time has to be placed into it. And along the way I hope to meet potential mentors who may steer me a little. I will utilize Youtube and other avenues to listen and observe experts in certain coding fields. I welcome you to join me on this trek.
